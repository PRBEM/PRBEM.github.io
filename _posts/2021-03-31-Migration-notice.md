We have decided to [migrate IRBEM to github][github]. We believe this will
allow the community to best be involved in the development of the library.

The IRBEM project is an international effort, and welcomes any contribution.
Please raise any issue (bug reports, usage questions, feature requests, ...)
on our [github Issues page][issues]. See directly on the IRBEM project page
for more information on how to get involved.

The [IRBEM-extras project][extras] will contain the developer-contributed
packages that were previously hosted on Sourceforge alongside the library.
